 * The initial implementation of the verb `Identify` is done in scope of [MODOAIPMH-15](https://issues.folio.org/projects/MODOAIPMH/issues/MODOAIPMH-15). The system properties are used for now to prepare response:
   + `repository.name` - the name of the repository which is used to construct value for `OAI-PMH/Identify/repositoryName` element.
   + `repository.baseURL` - the URL of the repository (basically the URL of the edge-oai-pmh) to be returned in `OAI-PMH/Identify/baseURL` element.
   + `repository.adminEmails` - the e-mail address of an administrator(s) of the repository to be returned in `OAI-PMH/Identify/adminEmail` element(s). Might contain several emails which should be separated by comma.

   The default values can be overwritten by VM arguments e.g. `-Drepository.name=Specific_FOLIO_OAI-PMH_Repository`
   Please refer to [config.properties](src/main/resources/config/config.properties) to check all the properties used.
   Also there is possibility to specify another configuration file via `-DconfigPath=<path_to_configs>` but the file should be accessible by ClassLoader

 * The initial implementation of the verb ListSets is done in scope of [MODOAIPMH-14](https://issues.folio.org/projects/MODOAIPMH/issues/MODOAIPMH-14)
